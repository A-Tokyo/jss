### Features:

- Truly namespaces.
- Direct access to values and variables from javascript allows to avoid DOM round trip.
- Decide whether to inject a style element or to apply styles directly on element.
- Detach styles from render tree when not used - increases performance.
- All the features you might know from [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) or [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and much more.
- No need to learn any new syntax.
- No need to precompile, but you can.
